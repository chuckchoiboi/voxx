# Discovery

This document captures the raw, unfiltered idea or initial AI prompt that sparked the project.

## Starting Prompt

**[USER TODO: Describe what you are trying to create here]**
Voxx is a voice journaling app that allows users to record their thoughts and memories using voice entries. Users can create journal entries by recording audio, which is then transcribed and summarized by an AI service. The app presents a clean, simple interface with a list of journal entries, organized from newest to oldest, and each entry includes a play button for the audio and a summary generated by AI. The goal is to make journaling easier, especially for those who prefer speaking over typing.

## Q&A

**[AI AGENT TODO: Ask the user as many questions as you need to fully understand the project. Try not to overload the USER with too many though. Remember you can have follow up questions after the USER answers the initial ones.]**

**[AI AGENT TODO: When iterating on the q&a, separate new questions by sections (e.g. \*** Clarification Questions **\* ).]**
