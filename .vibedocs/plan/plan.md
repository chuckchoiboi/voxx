## Overview
_A quick summary of what this plan is for and what product it's implementing._

This implementation plan outlines the technical approach for building Voxx, an iOS voice journaling app that uses AI to transcribe and summarize voice recordings. The app will provide a simple, voice-first journaling experience with local storage and intelligent organization features.

## Architecture
_High-level structure and major technical decisions. Include how the system is organized (e.g., client-server, monolith, microservices) and the proposed tech stack (frameworks, languages, storage, deployment)._

**Architecture:** Native iOS app with cloud API integration
**Tech Stack:**
- **iOS Native:** Swift + UIKit/SwiftUI for native performance and audio handling
- **Audio Framework:** AVFoundation for recording and playback
- **Local Storage:** Core Data for persistent storage of entries, categories, and analytics
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for transcription and summarization
- **Networking:** URLSession for API calls
- **Testing:** XCTest for unit and UI testing
- **Development:** Xcode, iOS Simulator, physical device testing

## Components
_What are the key parts/modules of the system and what do they do?_

- **Audio Recording Manager** - Handles voice recording, playback, and audio file management
- **AI Service Layer** - Manages OpenAI API calls for transcription and summarization
- **Data Manager** - Core Data stack for local storage and data persistence
- **Entry List View** - Main interface displaying chronological list of journal entries
- **Search Engine** - Full-text search functionality across transcribed content
- **Category Manager** - Handles predefined and custom category creation/assignment
- **Analytics Engine** - Tracks usage patterns, streaks, and generates insights
- **Settings & Preferences** - User configuration and app preferences

## Data Model
_What are the main types of data or objects the system will manage?_

- **JournalEntry** - Core entity with audio file path, transcript, summary, timestamp, category, duration
- **Category** - Predefined and custom categories with name, color, icon
- **AudioFile** - File metadata, path, duration, file size
- **SearchIndex** - Optimized search data for quick full-text search
- **AnalyticsData** - Usage statistics, streaks, word counts, mood tracking data
- **UserPreferences** - App settings, default categories, notification preferences

## Major Technical Steps
_What are the major technical steps required to implement this product? Keep the tasks high-level and milestone-focused (e.g., "Build user input form," not "Write handleInput() function"). These will guide the AGENT or dev team in breaking down the work further._

- **Setup iOS Project Structure** - Create Xcode project, configure Core Data, setup basic navigation
- **Implement Audio Recording System** - Build recording interface, audio file management, playback functionality
- **Integrate OpenAI API** - Setup API client, implement transcription and summarization calls
- **Build Entry Management System** - Create data models, Core Data stack, CRUD operations
- **Design Main Interface** - Entry list view, recording button, playback controls
- **Implement Search Functionality** - Full-text search across transcripts and summaries
- **Build Category System** - Predefined categories, custom category creation, assignment UI
- **Add Analytics Features** - Streak tracking, usage statistics, mood analysis
- **Polish UI/UX** - Refine interface, add animations, optimize user experience
- **Testing & Optimization** - Unit tests, UI tests, performance optimization, bug fixes

## Tools & Services
_What tools, APIs, or libraries will be used?_

- **OpenAI API** - Speech-to-text transcription and text summarization
- **Xcode & iOS SDK** - Primary development environment and framework
- **AVFoundation** - Audio recording, playback, and processing
- **Core Data** - Local data persistence and management
- **Core Audio** - Low-level audio processing if needed
- **URLSession** - Network requests for API calls
- **XCTest** - Unit and UI testing framework
- **SF Symbols** - Apple's icon system for consistent UI elements

## Risks & Unknowns
_What might block us, or what needs more investigation?_

- **OpenAI API Costs** - Usage costs may scale unexpectedly with user growth
- **Audio Quality Variations** - Different recording environments may affect transcription accuracy
- **iOS Permission Handling** - Microphone permissions and user privacy concerns
- **Storage Limitations** - Audio files may consume significant local storage over time
- **Network Dependency** - Offline functionality limited without internet for AI processing
- **API Rate Limits** - OpenAI API rate limiting may affect user experience
- **iOS Version Compatibility** - Need to determine minimum iOS version support

## Milestones
_What are the major implementation phases or delivery checkpoints?_

- **MVP Foundation (Week 1-2)** - Basic recording, playback, and local storage working
- **AI Integration (Week 3-4)** - OpenAI API integration with transcription and summarization
- **Core Features (Week 5-6)** - Entry list, search functionality, basic categorization
- **Enhanced UX (Week 7-8)** - Polished interface, analytics, category management
- **Testing & Refinement (Week 9-10)** - Comprehensive testing, bug fixes, performance optimization
- **App Store Preparation (Week 11-12)** - Final polish, screenshots, app store submission

## Environment Setup
_What setup steps are needed to start development or run the app?_

- **Install Xcode** - Latest version from Mac App Store or Apple Developer portal
- **Apple Developer Account** - Required for device testing and app store submission
- **OpenAI API Key** - Sign up for OpenAI account and obtain API credentials
- **iOS Device** - Physical iPhone for testing audio recording and microphone functionality
- **Configure Project** - Setup bundle identifier, signing certificates, and provisioning profiles
- **Environment Configuration** - Create config files for API keys and environment variables
- **Core Data Setup** - Initialize Core Data stack with data models
