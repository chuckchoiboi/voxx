# Release Design Document : v0.1.0-mvp-foundation
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release.

## 1. Features Summary
_Overview of features included in this release._

This foundational release establishes the core voice journaling capabilities:
- **iOS Project Setup** (F01) - Complete Xcode project with Core Data configuration
- **Audio Recording** (F02) - Unlimited length voice recording functionality
- **Audio Playback** (F03) - Play recorded audio entries with controls
- **Local Storage** (F04) - Core Data setup for persistent journal entry storage
- **Basic UI** (F05) - Simple, intuitive recording interface

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this release. May include information about the frontend stack, backend / api, authentication, database, deployment, etc._

**Frontend:** Native iOS app using Swift and UIKit/SwiftUI
**Audio Framework:** AVFoundation for recording and playback
**Database:** Core Data with SQLite backend for local storage
**File Management:** Documents directory for audio file storage
**Architecture Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for clean separation
**No Backend:** Completely local implementation, no server dependencies

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this release._

- **Audio File Format:** Use M4A format for optimal quality/size balance
- **Permissions:** Request microphone access on first recording attempt
- **Core Data Stack:** Single persistent container with journal entry entity
- **File Naming:** UUID-based naming for audio files to prevent conflicts
- **Recording States:** Handle start, recording, paused, stopped, and playback states
- **Memory Management:** Ensure proper cleanup of audio resources
- **Thread Safety:** Perform Core Data operations on appropriate queues

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this release._

- **Audio Session:** Configure AVAudioSession for recording and playback
- **Background Recording:** Handle app lifecycle during recording
- **Storage Limits:** Monitor available disk space for audio files
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of permission denials and storage issues
- **Performance:** Lazy loading of audio files and efficient Core Data queries
- **Testing:** Unit tests for data models, integration tests for audio functionality

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this release._

- **Minimum iOS Version:** What's the lowest iOS version we should support?
- **Audio Quality Settings:** What sample rate and bit rate should we use?
- **Recording Time Limits:** Should we have any practical limits despite "unlimited" requirement?
- **Storage Warnings:** At what storage threshold should we warn users?
- **Backup Strategy:** How should users handle data if they lose their device?
